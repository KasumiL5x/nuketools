# nuketools
nuketools is a collection of various tools I written at university for a 2d compositing module.  Everybody else in class was sticking to traditional compositing for their projects, so I decided to employ more technically-focused work instead.

# bumpy
Generates a normal map from an input image.

# check
Generates a checkerboard (code derived from an image editor).

# fractal
Generates fractal masks.

# gradient
Generates a radial gradient mask with a position and curve for falloff.

# kirei
A cluster of various image effects.
