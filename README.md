# nuketools
nuketools is a collection of various tools I made at university for a 2d compositing module.  Everybody else in class was sticking to traditional compositing for their projects, so I decided to employ more technically-focused work instead.

# bumpy
Converts an input image into a normal map with options for different algorithms, normalization, etc.

# check
Generates a checkerboard mask.

# fractal
Generates masks from various fractals with detailed control over each fractal.

# gradient
Generates a radial gradient mask based on a custom user-provided curve and position.

# kirei
Various image filters, such as temperature grading, channel mixing, vignette, and many more.

# multi render
Script to render all selected nodes automagically.
